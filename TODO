Allow install to arbitrary location
    Remove the lib folder
    Make --> create lib and include in correct location,
    and copy headers from source to include when building.

eispack.h, eispack.cc, pdgen.cc and wheeler.cc are not included in the project but required to build (figure out
relation with those)

Usage instructions in README.md

Create a soot model factory
Create an empty soot model interface that is implemented by a base soot model which is inherited by the other solutions

Create some simplified gas model that the soot model factory implements
This could be implemented with an object that has several parallel vectors (like is currently being used) with setters
and getters that assert that all the vectors are the same length (which they will not be if they have not been set)

Add LICENSE

Rename tests to be generalized
