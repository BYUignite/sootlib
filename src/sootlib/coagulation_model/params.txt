In the mono model, the coagulation rate is calculated with abcs[0] and abcs[0], which is an array of abscissas which is
only ever 1 long and it is either 0 or the ratio of the second moment / first moment

In the LOGN model, the coagulation rate is calculated with mD and mD, which are the m_dimer

In the MOMIC model, the coagulation rate appears to be calculated by a custom function

In the QMOM model, the coagulation rate is calculated with a few different values

It looks like the coagulation rate function is used in a more general sense than just one way inside soot
